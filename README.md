# BSQA
Package to analyse MRI data acquired as part of the NHSBSP.  

Weekly NHSBSP User QC Work Instructions describes an example method of acquiring the data to be analysed.  In this example T2w SE images are acquired for SNR and uniformity analysis and T1w GRE images are acquired with and without suppression for contrast and suppression effectiveness analysis.

BSQA_analysis requires a config file to be placed in the same directory and named BSQA_config.ini.  An example config file is available

Please refer to the documents NHSBSP_analysis_code_user_guide for further details.
